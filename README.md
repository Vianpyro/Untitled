# Koch Snowflake Challenge

During a boring class, my friend [Romain](https://github.com/RomainBoiret) and I were reminiscing about the Scratch projects we made when we were younger. We stumbled upon [his old project that generated a Koch Snowflake](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/285992999/), and I challenged him to recreate it in JavaScript. I couldn’t resist joining the challenge, even though I’m not as experienced in JavaScript as he is. This project is the result of that friendly competition!

## Project Overview

The Koch Snowflake is a mathematical curve and one of the earliest fractals to have been described. It's constructed by iteratively modifying an equilateral triangle, extending the edges to form increasingly complex shapes.

In this project, we aimed to recreate the Koch Snowflake using HTML5 canvas and JavaScript. The goal was to refresh our coding skills, challenge ourselves, and have some fun in the process.

## Features

- **Fractal generation**: Iteratively creates the Koch Snowflake using JavaScript.
- **Canvas drawing**: Renders the fractal on an HTML5 canvas.

## How to Run

Go to [this project's GitHub Pages](https://vianpyro.github.io/Untitled/) or:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Vianpyro/Untitled.git
    ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to see the Koch Snowflake.

## Code Structure

- [**`index.html`**](index.html): Basic HTML file that sets up the canvas and includes the JavaScript.
- [**`main.css`**](src/css/main.css): Styles for the page.
- [**`script.js`**](src/javascript/main.js): Contains the logic for generating the Koch Snowflake.

## Future Improvements


- Add a slider to adjust the number of iterations to control the complexity of the snowflake.
- Add interactivity to dynamically change colors or save the generated fractal as an image.
- Optimize the drawing performance for higher iteration counts.
- Refactor the code for better modularity and readability.

## Lessons Learned

- Refreshed our JavaScript and Canvas API knowledge.
- Explored recursion and fractal geometry.
- Had fun collaborating and challenging each other to improve our skills!
